			<h1>Are hybrid cars worth it?</h1>
			<p> If you are in the market for a vehicle that will
			save fuel yet you are not willing to sacrifice power,
			you might think hybrid cars are right for you. The idea
			of hybrid cars seem captivating due to the new tax
			incentives in place <a href="http://electricvehicles.caa.ca/electric-vehicles-available-in-canada/hybrid-electric-vehicles-available-in-canada/">("CAA Electric Vehicles”) </a>. Also 
			the fact that an electric motor is cooperating with a gas 
			motor to give you <strong> maximum power </strong> while saving you fuel seems 
			tempting to purchase one.  In this essay we will explore why 
			hybrid are not financially efficient and the misconception of
			hybrid vehicles using very little energy.</p>

			<h2> Any Pros? </h2>
			
			<p> Before discussing the issue’s with hybrid vehicles we first
			have to know and understand how they work. A hybrid car works by combining
			two smaller engines to produce the power of a larger engine. Usually, it's a
			gas engine and an electric engine. For instance, in the Toyota Prius it's 
			currently a 106 horsepower I-4 engine combined with a 67 horsepower electric
			engine to produce a 173 horsepower car. It is worth mentioning that hybrid 
			cars recharge themselves using regenerative braking. This information shows
			hybrid vehicles are more complex than traditional gas powered vehicles. Since
			there are various forms of this technology and it is fairly new, independent
			mechanics know very little about the vehicles. This means the customer can
			only rely on the dealer for technical issues. With the dealers knowing this,
			they will increase the cost of services and complicate warranty packages

			<h3> Pro's listed </h3>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>You Can Beat the EPA Mileage Estimates</strong> <br>
					Our goal was to double our observed fuel economy from the 22 mpg we had been getting with the Subaru. While we would have been happy with 44 mpg, or even the EPA rating of 48 mpg in the city, we were astonished to regularly see our fuel efficiency in the mid 50s. We credit efficient driving, aided by the Prius display, as the key to beating the EPA mileage estimates.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Hybrids Love the City</strong><br>
				Hybrids are unique in that their EPA mileage ratings are actually higher in the city than they are on the highway. Our Prius is perfectly suited to my wife’s daily commute in stop and go traffic. Every time you stop, it generates more electricity which can then be used at lower speeds, or for accelerating quickly. It is in town where we see our mileage jump above 50 mpg.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Hybrids Have Multi-Engine Power </strong><br> 
				The Prius is no hot rod, but, unlike a Ferrari, it actually comes with two engines. Its small gasoline engine is complemented by a powerful electric engine. Electric engines produce all of their torque from 0 rpm (revolutions per minute), a feature that allows the Prius to really scoot through an intersection from a stop. It is kind of like the snap you feel in your wrist when you operate a powerful electric hand tool.</li>

			<h2> City 
		
		<p id="important"> Although having two motors is complex, expensive to own and 
		maintain they do come with certain benefits worth explaining. At low speeds 
		electric engines are more efficient but during higher speeds the automobile will 
		automatically start the gas/diesel engine because gas/diesel engines deliver more power.
		An example would be, that a Toyota Prius often uses it’s electric engine during traffic or 
		travelling below 50 km/h. When travelling speeds over 60 Km/h the car turns it’s gas engine
		on. The gas engine charges the battery at the same time making the vehicle more fuel 
		efficient. (Toyota Canada/ Prius) .This is the true advantage of hybrid vehicles when 
		compared to electric vehicles. Electric car owners often have a fear of their batteries 
		running out and having no place to recharge their vehicles and this limits their way of
		transportation . Hybrid car owners don’t have to worry about range because they also have the 
		option of gasoline (Walczak, Jim).</p>
