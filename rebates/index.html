For many consumers, electric vehicles (EVs) are considered the new kid on the block, and may even seem futuristic to some. In fact, these “cars of the future” have actually been around for more than a century. They were the most popular mode of motorized transportation in the early 1900s until powerful internal combustion engines fueled by gas and diesel rendered them obsolete.
Today, electric cars are once again emerging as a viable alternative to fuel burning vehicles for a number of reasons: diminishing oil reserves, pollution from automobile emissions, and government regulations aimed at protecting the environment.
Energy costs for a battery electric vehicle (BEV, or electric vehicle) – a vehicle that operates on electricity alone – are estimated to be 3 to 5 times lower than for a traditional gas or diesel powered vehicle. There are other benefits as well: no oil changes, no tune ups, lower overall operating costs, and significant benefits to the environment.

No mode of transportation is perfect, and there are concerns about electric vehicles – higher purchase price, battery life, range, and the availability of charging stations. Hybrids and Plug-in Hybrids (HEVs and PHEVs) – which combine electrical and internal combustion engines – offer consumers better economies at purchase, among other benefits, but less in the way of energy savings and environmental impact.
